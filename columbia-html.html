  <h3 id="create-a-web-page">1. Creating a Web Page</h3>
  <p>
    This page was typed by hand. Anybody can do this,
    you don't need any special "web creation" tools or HTML editors,
    and the pages you make can be viewed from any browser.
    To see how this page was made, choose <b>View Source</b>
    (or View Page Source, or View Document Source)
    in your browser's menu (or — in at least Chrome and Firefox —
    Ctrl-U on your keyboard). A simple web page like this one is just
    plain text with HTML commands (markup) mixed in. HTML commands
    (properly called "tags") themselves are plain text.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you're just learning and want to experiment, you can do ever
    ything on your PC. Create a new directory ("folder") for your webs
    ite, and then put the web-page files (HTML plus any pictures) in i
    t. Use NotePad or other plain-text editor (not word processor) on
    your PC to create an index.html file, which you can view locally wi
    th your Web browser. (You can also use word processors such as Wor
    d or WordPad if you save in "plain text", "text", "text document",
    or "text document MS-DOS format".) <a href="#installing-your-web-page">Later</a> I'll explain how you can
    install your web site on the Internet.
  </p>
  <p><i>
      <dt>Example for Windows:</dt>
    </i>
    <dd>Move your mouse cursor to the desktop. Right-click, choose <i>New</i>,
      hen choose <i>Folder</i>, and a "New Folder" appears, with its name highlighted. Type "Web"
      to change the folder's name to Web (or anything else you want). Then start NotePad to
      create your first Web page.</dd>
  </p>

  <h3 id="html-syntax">2. HTML Syntax</h3>
  <p>
    Web pages are written in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). HTML has
    three special characters: &lt;, &amp;, &gt;. An HTML command is enclosed in &lt;...&gt;,
    for example &lt;p&gt;, which is a paragraph separator, or &lt;b&gt; ("begin bold") and
    &lt;/b&gt; ("end bold"). So the following HTML text:
  </p>
  <blockquote></blockquote>
  <pre>
             This sentence contains &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; text.
        </pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>

    produces:
  </p>
  <p>
    <blockquote>
      This sentence contains <b>bold</b> text.
    </blockquote>
  </p>
  <p>

    A Web page starts with a series of HTML commands, and ends with a few more. The contents go in between:
  </p>
  <p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
          &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
          &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;
          &lt;META charset="UTF-8"&gt;
          &lt;META name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
          &lt;title&gt;Sample Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;body&gt;
        </pre>
      <p>
        <i>(Contents go here)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre>
               &lt;/body&gt;
               &lt;/html&gt;
             </pre>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </p>
  <p>
    The first line (DOCTYPE) specifies which language
    the page uses (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> =
    Hypertext Markup Language); just copy this line. The next
    line, &lt;html&gt;, starts the page, and is matched
    by the last line, &lt;/html&gt;, which closes the
    page. &lt;head&gt;, starts the heading, which
    contains a title to be displayed on the browser's title bar and a
    declaration of the character set (nowadays it should always be
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>) and the "viewport"
    line which is a compulsory adaptation for cell phones, "smart" watches, etc.
    &lt;/head&gt; closes the heading.
  </p>
  <p>
    The &lt;body&gt; tag starts the body of the
    document, is closed by &lt;/body&gt; tag.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you can see, most HTML commands come in begin-end pairs:
    &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;,
    &lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;, etc. The closing part of the command
    has a slash (/) between the &lt; and the first letter of
    the command.
  </p>
  <p>
    Blank lines and line breaks are ignored. The browser automatically "flows"
    your text into lines and paragraphs that fit in its window. Paragraphs must
    be separated by &lt;p&gt;. Line breaks can be forced by
    &lt;br&gt;.
  </p>
  <p>
    <dl>
      <dt><i>Example for Windows:</i>
      <dd>Use the mouse to copy the HTML above into NotePad. Then save the file
        (<i>File</i>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<i>Save&nbsp;As...</i>)
        in your Web directory as index.html. Suppose your Windows username
        is Olga. Then (depending on which version of Windows you have) this might
        be:

        <p>
          <blockquote>
            <pre>
        C:\Documents and Settings\Olga\Desktop\Web\index.html
        </pre>
          </blockquote>
          <p>

            Now to see your new web page, just double-click on the Web folder and
            then double-click on index.html.
    </dl>
    <p>

      Now you're ready to start adding "content" to your web page. Go back to
      NotePad and replace the title and "(Contents go here)" with whatever you
      want. Any time you want to see the result, use
      <i>File</i>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<i>Save</i> in NotePad and then
      click the Reload button on your browser.

      <p>

        The next sections tell how to achieve different kinds of effects.

          <h3 id="special-characters">3. Special Characters</h3>
          <p>
            HTML special "character entities" start with ampersand (&amp;) and end with semicolon (;), like "&amp;euro"
            = "&euro;". The ever-popular "no-break space"
            is &amp;nbsp;. There are special entity names for accented Latin letters and other
            West European special characters such as:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote>

            When the page encoding is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>,
            which is recommended, you can also enter any character at all, Roman, Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek. Japanese,

          <p>
            If you have a plain text file that you want to convert to HTML, load the file into a
            plain-text editor and then follow these steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Change all occurrences of "&amp;" to "&amp;amp;".</li>
              <li>Change all occurrences of "&lt;" to "&amp;lt;".</li>
              <li>Change all occurrences of "&gt;" to "&amp;gt;".</li>
              <li>Change any accented letters to HTML entry names (previous section).</li>
              <li>Put "&lt;p&gt; between each paragraph."</li>
              <li>Insert the standard prolog at the top, substituing an appropriate title.</li>
              <li>Insert the standard epilog at the bottom.</li>
              <li>Save the result as xxx.html, where xxx is the part of the original file's name before
                the dot. For example, if the original file was letter.txt, save the edited version as
                letter.html.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/">Kermit</a> user, you can find
            a script to convert plain text to HTML <a
              href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckscripts.html#html">HERE</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the text contains lists, tables, or other structures, read on.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a Microsoft Word document you want to convert to HTML, and your copy
            of Word does not allow the file to be "Saved As" HTML, then save it as plain text
            and follow the same instructions. In this case you lose the "richness" (bold,
            italics, font changes, etc) when you save the file, and will have to put the effects
            back by hand (next section).

          <p>
            The rest of this document shows some of what you can do with simple HTML commands,
            but I don't explain how to do it. To see that, just tell your browser to
            <b>View Source</b> and compare the HTML in the source window with the result
            in the original window.

          <p>
            And here is a Description List (&lt;dl&gt;). Using Kermit commands as an example:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>SET FILE TYPE BINARY</dt>
            <dd>This command tells Kermit to transfer files in binary mode. In other words, don't mess with the file,
              just send it as-is. The result on the receiving computer should be identical to the original.</dd>
            <p>

            </p>
            <dt>SET FILE TYPE TEXT</dt>
            <dd>This command tells Kermit to transfer files in text mode. This should be used with plain-text files,
              especially when transferring them between computers with different file formats or operating systems, such
              as VMS and Unix, or Unix and Windows. It converts the file's format and character-set (if necessary) so
              the received file is usable on the destination computer.</dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            You can have lists within lists:

            <li>A gromet</li>
            <li>A widget</li>
